# ECommerce-Platform
This is a console-based Shopping Cart application developed using Core Java. The project simulates a simple FlipKart-like shopping experience, where users can register, log in, view products, and add items to a cart.  The main goal of this project is to understand OOP concepts, collections, and user interaction using Scanner in Java.
